google,5,"Hi all, I want to buy a pixel 5 but never used android coming from iOS but love the size and spec however, I notice that most shops are completely out! Is it because there are problems with this device? Has it been recalled? Sorry for asking but wanted to double check as the 4a is still available in all shops. Iâ€™d be grateful if someone knows or could let me know if they have had any experience. Thank you in advance "

google,5,"Google also needs to bring back HDR+ enhanced. Night Sight takes up to approximately 6.5 seconds (without counting the processing time) (proof: see Engadget's Pixel 5 youtube review at 11:45 , I have measured the duration), by the way, that's also the case with the Pixel 3a. 
HDR+ enhanced is a fast Night Sight mode and only takes up to 2.5 seconds, if you don't zoom. Instead of an exposure time of 1/2-1s per frame, it chooses 1/5s per frame, so you get nearly always sharp photos with HDR+ enhanced whereas Night Sight often leads to slightly blurry = worse photos or you need to take the photo again, then it's basically 13s vs 2.5s (actually even more than 2x6.5s=13s because you have to check whether the image is blurry). So Google really needs to bring back HDR+ enhanced, which can nearly always produce as bright photos as Night Sight, if you use exposure compensation. Apple's night mode only takes 1-3s."
google,5,"I hope that when the Pixel 6 is released, Google finally stops to spread lies. When the Pixel 3 was released, they said that their super resolution zoom was comparable with 2x optical zoom. It was a lie. In perfect light conditions without shadows it's even not as good as 1.1x optical zoom because there is basically no advantage at all (I have a Pixel 3a). 
When the Pixel 4 was released, they said that their zoom was comparable with 3x optical zoom. Again a lie. One can even show (mathematically and based on tests with Bayer cameras) that due to diffraction, that's physically impossible, if ""optical zoom"" is meant to be a sharp optical zoom."

google,5,"Help I have been going crazy the last few days youtubing googling night and day.  I currently have the huawei p20 pro which in good lighting takes very good pics.  Now I love the pics im seeing from the pixel 5: the depth and contrast of colours.(I did notice the selfie is a abit of a let down compared to its rear camera. However from looking at video's of pixel look 50/50 some look grainy/and loss of quality.  I do take pics more, but I still want the option to take good videos too.  Now i did narrow my choice to pixel 5 vs iphone 12pro.  i prefer pics taken by pixel but videos am i going to regret having poor quality videos?? or can the pixel match the iphone. Im tired of youtubing there's so many reviews that are blantenly biased.  Now to confuse things furthermore i don't mind considering the oppo x2find pro.  
I'm after a wow camera if there is a thing i mainly take pics of the kids and my cat (if that helps)-with google play services.  Out of the three I have mentioned has anyone outthere tested all 3?  
It don't help during lockdown that I cant go out and test a handet.   
Any suggestions will be appreciated!"

It's disappointing that it lacks... moreAre you kidding? The headphone jack is gone, yes I'd love to have it also, but let's face it, you won't be seeing many phones with it any more.
 
Expandable storage? No Pixel had ever had it. Honestly microSD cards are slow and prone to failure. Last time I used one was with my S5 which had 16GB storage. 
 
And you want a bigger battery? Pixel 5 had the biggest battery of any pixel and as a heavy user I'm happy with the battery life / size weight of the device.
 
Some people just want miracles and no matter what they put in a phone, someone will always want more and for a lower price. If anything I would say they got the features right, would be nice if they spent a bit more on build quality and refinement. "

I was really scared about this cause people write all sorts of things online but in reality it just works and I didn't feel annoyed or felt the quality of my calls was suffering whatsoever.

google,4,"Anonymous, 09 Nov 2020Bro, you use your phone to browse porn and Tiktok, why do you act like you need anything flags... moreWe are seeing the beginning of a trend change. 
Just like desktops did, phones will start to diverge in processing power as per user needs. 
We started seeing the ""G"" branded processors, and soon that would extend to things beyond a boost in GPU clock speed: 
Think of having an Intel i7 with a integrated graphics and Intel i7 with a discrete RTX3080. 
Both are flagship chipsets, but gaming on them (for those requiring it) is a night-and-day difference. System price is quite different as well. 
Today, the SD765 is closer to an i5 with a 1050Ti, for example, and the SD865 is an i7 with RTX3080...  
Can you really say that everyone needs an i7 with RTX3080? I don't think so 
Can you not play pretty much every game out there on an i5 with GTC 1050i? of you course you could at various degrees of resolution/quality degradations.
 
Also, are there not premium laptops with i5s? sure thing 
And thus, we are now heading into this trend, and I guess we will start seeing SD8x5 and SD8x5G processors as well as SD7x5 and SD 7x5G processors powering up phones, probably even the same phone model with just the processor/memory variations.
 
Apple so far is doing the opposite with keeping the same flagship chipset and downgrading the design on its various tiers, but that too I believe will soon change; but Apple will always be Apple, they will do whatever they feel like waking up in the morning and everybody will applaud and follow :D

I personally check that and the only time when you will see a difference is in intensive  gaming, but even then there will not be a big difference."
