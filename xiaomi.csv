Eh, I'd rather not have one more thing that I need to remember to charge every night.
 
Not saying TWS is bad, it's actually really great and I depend on it a lot during many situations, but it can't replace a wired set of earphones/IEMs. 
 
Honestly, I love both. I really do. But I cannot do without wired. And if I were to buy a phone with the jack, I'd just use an adapter then.
 
Why can't both wireless and wired live together in harmony? BTW don't answer that, that's a question for the big corporations."

If it&... moreIt is just isn't 90% perfect like the OxygenOS. Oxygen OS 10% is because of the lack of any animations and transitions (which is sometimes what people wanted and they don't care). And also the Nord N10 and N100 destroys the OxygenOS, it doesn't feel smooth (given the low end Snapdragons), only 1 year of updates which is dissapointing considering it launches at the year of Android 11 and it ships with Android 10 in the box which means you will be stuck with Android 10 "
xiaomi,5,"Anonymous, 01 Mar 2021I would think that those first 2 issues are what makes it not  a 'Great UI'.
If it&... moreWhat makes it an great UI you ask me? Plenty of reasons, like :
 
1. Animations and transitions in every tap, swipe, scroll gesture you make. It is very good in 90/120hz displays. You simply just notice it the difference between 90 and 60hz. Whereas stock android and oxygenos doesn't have those animations, so high refresh rates doesn't look as good as MIUI.
 
2. Plenty of customization, you can change icons, super wallpapers, themes, lock, charging/fingerprint animation
 
3. Just like the first point, every actiom you do will have an haptic feedback, yes even cheap phones from Xiaomi do. So even if the feedback isn't as good, it is still better than not getting an feedback. In Xiaomi Flagships, the feedback for every action you do even outclasses Apple's Taptic engine and Ios.
 
4. Promised Updates for at least 3 generations of MIUI (not android) no matter what phones you choose, cheap or super cheap. I mean, even Redmi Note 7 , which ships with Android 9, gets Android 11 and 3 versions of MIUI, sure you will not get Android 12, but you will later get MIUI 12.5 which is better than Oneplus giving only 1 years of updates. Even though the update is a bit slow, but still better than not getting updates. Even Realme, Oneplus, Oppo, Vivo, Huawei, Samsung entry level phones only gets one year updates.
 
4. Plenty of featues, like scollshot, screen recorder, DC dimming, vibration customization, clear speaker, and even fun ones, like an app exploding in your home screen when you delete it. 
 
5. Extreme levels of details just like Point 1 and 3. There's just so much attention to details. But at cheaper phones, this skin may be a bit too heavy for them. While on high end xiaomi phones, the UI is so awesome and also without ads (which i don't mind). The scanner app i also found it to be able to be deactivated, but i just let it on so it can continue to scan my apps from unknown sources or play store.
 
I am not an Xiaomi fanboy, i just like what i think are the best parts. And the positives of MIUI overshadows the negatives of it. Not like Huawei's EMUI and Vivo's Funtouch OS"

I highly recommend reading it before you come to conclusions about the HMX sensor. 
This isn't a small outdated sensor like you find on Pixel or iPhone.
