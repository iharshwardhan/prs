    <p>I already had a phone with problems... I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge. I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER....</p>

    <p>The charging port was loose. I got that soldered in. Then needed a new battery as well. $100 later (not including cost of purchase) I have a usable phone. The phone should not have been sold in the state it was in.</p>

  <div class="review-text">
    <p>I originally was using the Samsung S2 Galaxy for Sprint and wanted to return back to the Samsung EPIC 4G for Sprint because I really missed the keyboard, I really liked the smaller compact size of the phone, and I still needed some of the basic functions of a smart phone (i.e. checking e-mail, getting directions, text messaging) Because the phone is not as powerful as the newer cell phones out there, just be aware that the more applications you install the slower the phone runs and will most likely freeze up from time to time. But the camera works great, the video is great as well, and even the web browsing is decent and gives me what I need. I also notice that battery life lasts a little bit longer and charging the phone is much quicker than my Galaxy S2.</p>

    <p>It's battery life is great. It's very responsive to touch. The only issue is that sometimes the screen goes black and you have to press the top button several times to get the screen to re-illuminate.</p>

    <p>I'm really disappointed about my phone and service. The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.</p>

  <div class="review-text">
    <p>Ordered this phone as a replacement for the same model until my contract expires and I can get a new one. Seller confirmation said delivery could take up to 7 days. Seller sent out the phone within hours of receiving the order and I had the phone the next day. Phone looks better than described was able to transfer data from the old one to the new one with no problems. Highly recommend this seller</p>
