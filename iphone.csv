iphone,1,Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees.
iphone,5,Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon
iphone,1,"So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and thereâ€™s a glitch in the front cameraâ€™s portrait mode. Thatâ€™s fine, it may happen. But whatâ€™s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!"
iphone,5,"I've been an android user all my life until I decided to try iPhone XR for iOS. Loving the camera and battery life is an absolute joy to have. It's been more than one month since I got this phone and I'm loving it. Face ID works flawlessly even in the dark and the dual sim function is working like a charm, I'm using Vodafone as my primary sim and Jio as e-sim and have faced no problem whatsoever."
iphone,1,I was delivered a phone that did not work immediately after removing from the box. I was not able to return it as I need to first check with Apple. Apple service told me that the phone was lying without charge since 5 months and hence the battery failed. Now I have had to leave the phone with Apple for repairs and waiting for them to replace the battery. Please answer this: WHY SHOULD I RUN AROUND FOR THE SUB PAR QUALITY DEVICE WHEN I WAS SHIPPED A DEAD PHONE? Last time I ever purchase a phone online
iphone,5,"It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and Iâ€™m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase."
iphone,1,The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good.
iphone,4,I'll use this review to mostly say what I'm not a fan of in this particular iPhone model.
iphone,1,Went with the iPhone XR after over a month of consideration.Amazon was offering some really good discounts and felt the time was right to upgrade having used the iPhone 6 for four seamless years.

iphone,5,Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon
iphone,1,"Don't buy Apple products from Amazon. I got a defective product which is not activating. During first charging the iPhone started heating like anything. Since there was a 10 days replacement policy, so I asked Amazon to replace it as the product is defective. But very poor customer service from Amazon. They didn't change the iPhone rather told me to visit service centre. Now I am with a defective product which is not operating."
iphone,5,Face recognition is slower some times. I have no complaints about it. I am die hard fan of XR. I was eagerly waiting for dual sim iPhone. Itâ€™s heavy but looks are so attractive that you will be ready to carry that little extra weight. I am using it since two months. Donâ€™t watch any reviews. Just buy it and enjoy. Yes itâ€™s expensive. Sometimes rather many times money is not worth than happiness.
iphone,5,"Great Phone, I am happy with the phone so far."
iphone,5,"There are lots of reviews on net for XR, I would give just quick points based on my experience of XR 128 GB."
iphone,2,Donâ€™t buy this phone only waste of money it hangâ€™s many time.
iphone,1,STEVE JOBS GONE i phone gone !!!!!!
iphone,3,Single SIM is working fine but if you are using E-sim in this phone. Not good quality for dual sim. Many times Number showing switched off.
iphone,1,It is not supporting any type of sim.. the network gets disconnected after sometime only
iphone,5,"i always was unhappy with the size of my previous iPhones (iPhone 7 and 5s), I badly needed an upgrade and but donâ€™t have the budget of 1lakh so I took my chances with XR and I am very happy with my purchase."
iphone,3,This is a product which lets down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down.
